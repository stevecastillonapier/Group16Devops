# Code Of Conduct
## Our Pledge

Welcome to the GROUP 16 DEVOPS Team!
We are dedicated to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone involved. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to support and show respect to all team members—whether they are reporting issues, suggesting new features, improving documentation, submitting pull requests, or engaging in any other form of contribution.

## Our Standards

These are examples of behaviors that contribute to creating a positive environment:

1. Be Respectful: Treat others with kindness and respect and empathy. We are all here to collaborate and learn from one another.
2. Be inclusive: We welcome contributions from all members as it is necessary that all members contribute towards this project so to be completed on time.
3. Be collaborative: Work together with all members to achieve common goals. Support and encourage each other’s efforts.
4. Be constructive: Provide helpful feedback and criticism with the intention of improving the project. Avoid derogatory or inflammatory remarks.
5. Be mindful of language: Use inclusive language and avoid offensive or inappropriate language in all interactions within the project.

## Commitment to Continuous Learning
We recognize that technology and best practices are always evolving. Each team member is encouraged to keep learning, share new insights, and support others in improving their skills. We value curiosity, humility, and the willingness to seek help or teach others when needed.

## Respect for Different Time Zones
As a distributed team, we acknowledge that members may be located in different regions or countries. We commit to being mindful of meeting times, response expectations, and deadlines. Communication should always be considerate of others’ working hours and personal schedules.

## Responsibility in Version Control Practices
We use Git and GitHub to collaborate effectively and maintain code quality. Every contributor is responsible for following version control best practices — including creating clear branches, writing meaningful commit messages, resolving merge conflicts respectfully, and reviewing pull requests carefully before approval.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our project:
- Harassment, discrimination, or intimidation of any form.
- Offensive or inappropriate language or imagery.
- Personal attack or derogatory comments.
- Trolling, spamming, or other disruptive behavior.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

If you experience or witness any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it immediately to the project team leader Steve Castillo. All reports will be reviewed and addressed promptly and confidentially.

## Enforcement

The Project team leader is responsible for enforcing this code of conduct. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The team leader will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.
